### VS Code configurations
#### Make Vs Code behave more like vim

This configuration takes a lot from videos and tutorials around the internet, which I will cite and credit here.

The configuration itself consists of an aesthetc feel comparable (and surprisingly identical) to my own oncfiguration of LazyVim by Folke.

The reason I am starting this little project is that I am finding myself less and less able (and willing) to cope with the extremely fast-paced Neovim environment.

While my desire for a less bloated IDE or PDE is stronger than ever, and recognising I cannot go back to normal typing without vim motions, when it comes to sheer prductivity, having to deal with the ever ending issues of Neovim is a real time sink.

I only see two possible way forwards:

 - A - keep up with Neovim but stop ricing it.
 - B - Use Vs Code as if it were Neovim while not renouncing to the huge amount pf plugins and customisation the editor offers.

 ### I have a problem: ricing
 I do. I love it, though. It's a massive time-sink, do not ever forget that. You see, the thing about riciing is, it's a never ending process: the more you rice, the cooler it looks, the more you have to spend time maintaining your configuration. Something breaks, and there you have it: your wonderful and fantastically customised environment is ruined. You have that big project you need to work on, but then again, that statusbar cannot be left as it is, am I right?

 My point is: default things ***rarely breaks*** while highly customised ones, often do. Default things look ugly, but you set them up once, and forget about it. Riced things look stunning, but you are costantly tweaking, adjusting, adding.

    So nturally, the best case scenario here is: have rice things maintained by someone else and that you only have to update as regularly as non-riced things. Ain't that the best?

 ### Bloated IDE - what does that even mean?

 It means (to me) that a thousand menus, buttons, panes and and bars are not what makes an editor productive. On the other hand, a single black pane with a cursor that requires 5 key strokes to do a search&replace is arguably productive.

So what then?

*compromise*

That is indeed a great thing. I want to rice my IDE, ***and forget about it*** for a year or so.
I want to customise my IDE and experiment with new languages ***easily and whenever I need to***
I want to be able to avail of the lates and greatest stuff (if I do so feel inclined) like Copilot X, without waiting for someone to build a plugin.

### But Vim is light, Vs Code is heavy as hell, etc. etc.

In 2023, with phones having 8GB of RAM and laptops getting easily 16/32/64 cuts, are we really worried about Vs Code eating RAM?
I work on macOS as well as Linux Arch (and other distros too in the past), from the latest and most powerful macBook Pro, to miniPC's and gaming laptop, I can say I have tried all major architecures and SOC's. ***Not once Vs Code has ever been a performance problem***, and I feel this has to be said loud and clear. 
Is it faster than Vim? Hell no. Faster than Neovim? Nope. Does it matter to a human being using the tool? Definitely no.

### So what is left then?

I'll keep using Neovim/LazyVim as usual, but now that I am learning Rust, and after spending 3 minutes configuring Vs Code to be fullly prepared to handle rust compiling, debugging and testing, I can confidently say that my main editor is probably gonna be Vs Code.
I made it look like Neovim, behave like Neovim, and I still retain all the cool features only Vs Code can easily give you access to.

At the end of the day, the real question is: if you can pull off what I have just described, why not do it and spend more time learning, and less time ricing and debuggin your editor?
